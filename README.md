* I am not associated with gemini, just an engineer interested in the tech


Figured I could just start a repository as I work through the examples to make it easier for people to get from 0 to using the Gemini API in as little time as possible.

:D


4/12/21 - After having a few days to rest following the rabbit hole I fell into, I've started attempting to clean up the code from my proof of concept to try and make it as useful to others as possible. This is also helping me practice Python as much as possible through trying to tackle fun projects since I'm now seeing the majority of "fin-tech" tools seem to be built in Python. Coming from a primarily dot net stack from the last 5 years, this has been a really really fun challenge attempting to merge my interest in finance and software engineering together with tools around trading.
